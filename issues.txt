add BOOL constants, NULL in lex -> chesaka cheppandi
changes in 7.1 
in add or drop columns one can add an array or list of columns or one column at a time
one can drop column by passing its id(index) instead of name and also using combination of both of them. ie [1,"col2",3,4]
df.write() can be written as 
df.write(file_name ,headers ,df);
df.write(file_name , df); where no headers will be printed in csv
get can also take columns ids or column names or a combination of both.
will it be better to write a function to get metadata of a df?
suggest (or let's schedule a meet to get) a valid syntax for predicate logic for df.
